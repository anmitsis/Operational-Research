# Operational Research 

This repository is dedicated to the memory of **Ι. Κολέτσος**, an exceptional professor who made a lasting impact on my understanding and appreciation of **Operational Research**. His teaching was not only insightful but also inspiring, and his passion for the subject was contagious. Sadly, he passed away, but his contributions to the field and to his students' lives continue to resonate.

I created this repository to showcase some of the projects I worked on in my **Operational Research** course. While this isn't my main area of focus, I genuinely enjoyed the subject because of how practical and applicable it is to real-world problems. The course introduced me to optimization techniques that businesses rely on every day, and I was surprised at how powerful **Excel** and its **Solver** tool can be for tackling these challenges. Even though the models are relatively basic, they demonstrate how mathematical approaches can significantly improve efficiency and decision-making in different industries.

I’ve included a few of my favorite projects here:

- **Project Management**: We optimized an agricultural organization that grows weeds to improve their resource allocation and operational efficiency.
- **Game Theory**: Applied the **minimax strategy** to analyze competitive scenarios and determine optimal strategies in decision-making processes.
- **Inventory Control**: Developed models for managing stock in a business selling **electric cars**, balancing holding costs with order frequency.
- **Transportation and Assignment Problem**: Worked on optimizing emergency **aircraft landing** logistics to minimize time and resource usage.

I wanted to share these because I think **Operational Research** represents some of the most **useful math out there for companies**, offering practical solutions to everyday business challenges. Plus, it was fun seeing how a simple tool like Excel can solve such complex problems!

Finally, for anyone who might be interested, I highly recommend the book **"Εισαγωγή στην Επιχειρησιακή Έρευνα"** by **Ι. Κολέτσος** and **Δ. Στογιάννης**. It’s an excellent resource that dives deep into the fundamentals of Operational Research and reflects the brilliant teaching of **Ι. Κολέτσος**, whose legacy continues to inspire. The book focuses strictly on the **mathematical side** of the subject, making it a valuable guide for anyone looking to understand the rigorous analytical methods behind OR.
